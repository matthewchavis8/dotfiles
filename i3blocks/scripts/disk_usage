# disk_usage: Script to display disk usage for a given mount point.
# The mount point is passed as $BLOCK_INSTANCE (e.g., / or /home).

# Get the mount point from $BLOCK_INSTANCE, default to / if not set
MOUNT_POINT="${BLOCK_INSTANCE:-/}"

# Get disk usage: Used, Total, Percentage
# df -h output for /:
# Filesystem      Size  Used Avail Use% Mounted on
# /dev/sda1        20G   10G  8.0G  56% /
# We want the "Avail" part.
# Use df -P to prevent line wrapping and ensure consistent output.
# Use awk to parse.

# Output: Available space
