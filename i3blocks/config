# i3blocks configuration file
# Main configuration file: ~/.config/i3blocks/config
# Scripts directory: ~/.config/i3blocks/scripts/

# Global properties
command=/usr/share/i3blocks/$BLOCK_NAME
# If the script is not found in /usr/share/i3blocks, it will try to find it in this directory.
# If you want to use your own scripts, uncomment the following line and comment the one above.
# command=~/.config/i3blocks/scripts/$BLOCK_NAME

# Your colors
color=#ffffff # Default text color (statusline)
# background=#2c001e # Default background - i3bar handles this
separator_block_width=10
markup=pango # Allows Pango markup for more styling, like font selection within a block

# Separator character (using your preferred color)
separator=true
# Full text for separator - you can use a Nerd Font icon here too if you like
# For example, if you want a vertical line icon:
# full_text=|
# Or a dot:
# full_text=·
# color for separator
# separator_color=#666666 # This will be handled by i3bar's separator color if not set per block

# --- Define your blocks here ---
# Each [blockname] section defines a block.
# 'command' points to the script that generates the output for this block.
# 'interval' defines how often the script is run (in seconds).
# 'label' is a static prefix (e.g., an icon).

# Workspace Block (using i3-msg, no separate script needed for basic functionality)
# This is often handled directly by i3bar itself, but i3blocks can also manage it.
# For simplicity, we'll let i3bar handle workspace display as per your original config.
# If you want i3blocks to handle workspaces, you'd need a more complex script.
